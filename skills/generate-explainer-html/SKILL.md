# generate-explainer-html

Turn a `core.yaml` (meaning) + `view.yaml` (presentation strategy) pair into a
**self-contained HTML bundle** that:

- shows a **tailored explanation UI inside an iframe**, with a **view switcher** in the
  right pane so the reader can flip between multiple representations, and
- offers **copyable prompt templates outside the iframe** so the user can ask another
  local-file-reading AI to **add another switchable view**.

This is the **second half** of the pipeline. The `core.yaml` / `view.yaml` come from the
**`generate-explainer-yaml`** skill (or the user). This skill reads them **by absolute
path**, authors iframe view documents, and assembles the bundle.

```
core.yaml + view.yaml  (from generate-explainer-yaml)
  ↓ design + generate (this skill)
HTML bundle: index.html (light/dark shell + view switcher + prompt cards)
             + views/NN-<id>.html  (one switchable iframe view each)
```

## The bundle (the output)

The output is a **directory**, not a single file:

```
<bundle>/
  index.html          shell: header (theme toggle) + left prompt pane + right view switcher + ONE <iframe>
  views.json          ordered manifest of views {id, label, file}
  core.yaml           copied in (its absolute path is cited by the prompts)
  view.yaml           copied in
  views/
    01-<id>.html       an iframe view document (full <!DOCTYPE html>, light default)
    02-<id>.html
```

The right-pane iframe loads one view at a time via `src="views/<file>"`; the tab switcher
swaps it. Views are **additive** — each new one becomes another tab; existing views and the
shell/prompts are never rewritten.

Do **not** hand-edit `index.html` or the prompts — `scripts/build_html.py` is their only
author. You author **iframe view documents** only. Do **not** build a web app, server, API,
or chat UI, and do **not** depend on any external CDN/CSS/JS.

## Steps

1. **Get the YAML pair.** Take the absolute paths to `core.yaml` and `view.yaml` (from the
   `generate-explainer-yaml` skill, or the user). **Read them.** If they don't exist yet,
   produce them with `generate-explainer-yaml` first.

2. **Author one iframe view document** — a full `<!DOCTYPE html>` document tailored to the
   target and reader. Choose the form(s) from `view.yaml` (table, worktree, cards, faq,
   comparison, sequence, reading path, risk/dependency/impact map, glossary, tutorial,
   review checklist, …). It must include source references, important concepts, relations,
   what to read next, and next questions, and have real visual structure. It must be **light
   by default** and read `#theme` from its own URL hash (load + `hashchange`). Inline
   CSS/JS only; no network. Follow `references/html-generation-rules.md`. Example:
   `references/sample-iframe.html`.

3. **Author the prompt templates** as a `prompts.json` array — the "add a view" cards
   (table, worktree, beginner, engineer, PdM/Biz, free-form). Each cites the YAML via
   `{{core_yaml_path}}` / `{{view_yaml_path}}` and **must not** embed YAML content. Patterns:
   `references/prompt-template-patterns.md`. Starter set: `references/sample-prompts.json`.

4. **Build the bundle** with `scripts/build_html.py` (see below). Pass `--core` / `--view`
   (copied in; their absolute paths feed the prompt placeholders) and one or more
   `--view-html "ラベル=その.html"`.

5. **Validate** the bundle with `scripts/validate_html.py` on `index.html` **and** every
   `views/*.html`. Fix any error and re-validate until it exits 0.

6. **Hand the user the bundle folder** with open instructions (below). Summarize which views
   exist and which "add a view" templates are available.

## Adding a view later (the additive flow)

To add a representation next to the existing ones — **do not overwrite**:

1. Author one more iframe view document (or have a local-file-reading AI do it via a copied
   prompt — those prompts already say "read the YAML at the given path; return one new view").
2. Re-run the build with **only the new view**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/build_html.py --bundle <dir> --prompts <prompts.json> \
     --view-html "テーブル=table.html"
   ```
   It **appends** the view to `views.json` and regenerates `index.html` with a new tab. The
   existing views, the shell, and the prompts are preserved. (Re-running with an existing
   label updates that view in place instead of duplicating it.)

## Using the scripts

> Note: invoke with `python3` if `python` is not on PATH.

Build / grow the bundle:

```bash
python scripts/build_html.py \
  --bundle ./explainer-bundle \
  --core /abs/path/core.yaml \
  --view /abs/path/view.yaml \
  --prompts prompts.json \
  --view-html "エンジニア=engineer.html" \
  --view-html "テーブル=table.html"
```

`--bundle` and `--prompts` are required; `--core` / `--view` are optional (recommended — the
prompts cite their absolute path) and are left in place on a re-run if omitted; `--view-html`
is repeatable and appends/updates views.

Validate (safety / self-containment check), including every view file:

```bash
python scripts/validate_html.py ./explainer-bundle/index.html ./explainer-bundle/views/*.html
```

`build_html.py` is an **assembler**, not a renderer: it never turns `core.yaml` into a fixed
diagram. The understanding UI is the iframe view document(s) you authored in step 2.

## Opening the bundle

- **Chrome/Edge block `file://` iframe loads.** Open `index.html` in **Firefox** over
  `file://`, or serve the folder with a trivial local static server (e.g.
  `python3 -m http.server` run **inside the bundle dir** — it reads only local files; the
  no-network rule constrains the *content*, not how you serve the folder).
- The right-pane tabs switch views; the header toggle flips light/dark for the shell and
  propagates the theme into the iframe via the `#theme` hash.

## Troubleshooting

- **`validate_html.py` fails on an `http://` / `https://` string** — a URL leaked into a
  `source_ref` or a prompt body. URLs are labels here, not live links: drop the scheme
  (write `example.com/path`) or remove the URL, then re-validate.
- **`validate_html.py` fails on `fetch(` / `XMLHttpRequest` / `localStorage` / etc.** — the
  forbidden token appears literally inside a prompt body or a view. Reword it generically;
  see `references/prompt-template-patterns.md` → "Safety wording inside prompt bodies".
- **Iframe is blank in Chrome over `file://`** — expected; use Firefox or serve the folder.
- **`build_html.py: --view-html must be "LABEL=PATH"`** — pass each view as `ラベル=パス`.
- **`build_html.py: no views to build`** — pass at least one `--view-html`, or build into a
  bundle that already has a `views.json`.
- **A view tab 404s** — its `views/NN-*.html` was removed; rebuild it with `--view-html`.
- **Empty or trivial input** — if there is no real target to explain, ask the user for the
  actual document / repo / PR and produce the YAML first; do not emit an empty explainer.

## Try it with the bundled sample

```bash
python scripts/build_html.py \
  --bundle ./sample-bundle \
  --core ../generate-explainer-yaml/references/sample-core.yaml \
  --view ../generate-explainer-yaml/references/sample-view.yaml \
  --prompts references/sample-prompts.json \
  --view-html "エンジニア=references/sample-iframe.html"

python scripts/validate_html.py ./sample-bundle/index.html ./sample-bundle/views/*.html
```

Open `sample-bundle/index.html` (Firefox / served). The right pane shows an
engineer-oriented PR explanation (worktree + reading order + review checklist); the left
pane has the copyable "add a view" templates and the YAML viewers.
